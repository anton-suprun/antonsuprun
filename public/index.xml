      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring using tmux and fzf for a workspace management. I wanted a quick way to navigate and jump between projects. Here is what I came up with.&#xA;Prerequisites Before you can use this workspace navigator, ensure you have the following installed:&#xA;tmux - a terminal multiplexer fzf - a command-line fuzzy finder fd - a simple, fast alternative to find Note: You&amp;rsquo;ll need to have tmux running to use the display-popup command.</description>

      <description>Hi,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m Anton.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer, currently working at Amazon in Toronto. My focus is on data privacy. I develop authorization and access management microservices. Working mainly with Java, Typescript and AWS&#xA;Before Amazon, I worked at Nesto in Montreal, where I designed and built an AI-powered tool for automatic document verification using Go. I&amp;rsquo;ve also completed co-op terms at Wealthsimple, Amazon and PointClickCare. By some miracle, I&amp;rsquo;ve consistently had the luck of getting to work on rather exciting and challenging green-field projects; I hope this luck follows me into every job I ever have because I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about building impactful projects.</description>
