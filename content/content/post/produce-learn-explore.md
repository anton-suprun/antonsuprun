I love spending time on the computer and whenever I do I find myself in one of three modes:

- Produce: I'm working on a project and want to have a finished, published product 
- Learn: I'm learning a new language, tool, concept, etc
- Explore: I'm exploring new tools on Github, Hackernews, reading documentation for various cli tools I use, etc. 

I am often torn between these modes. For example, sometimes while I'm producing, I will use a certain git command and will immediately be tempted to try to write a script to make the command more convenient or more flexible and so I will dive into exploring.
And likewise when I'm exploring, I might come across a language feature and want to deep dive it to learn more; I end up learning.



I have been slowly developing a system (or maybe I should use the word mental framework for how I split and manage my time) to improve my process of not jumping back and forth between these modes.
Each mode has their benefits. Exploring is my favourite; I love nothing more than to zone out and read some esoteric docs on a cli tool that I already use or a new one. It lets me wonder and I let myself wonder; if I get bored, I just exlore another tool.
Producing is the most satisfying in the long term and learning is the most beneficial and makes me more effective (add more on deliberate practice)
