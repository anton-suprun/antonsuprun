In my past as a university student, having had the minimal exposure I had with office spaces - one thing always bothered me; the amount of time people are sitting is obscene - it can't be healthy. My intuition was not wrong - sitting is the [new smoking](https://news.sanfordhealth.org/heart/sitting-is-the-new-smoking-truly-a-silent-killer/). 

However, after being introduced to competitive gaming by my brother - sitting stopped being a big deal to me. I was so engaged in the game that I could literally focus and sit for hours in the most grotesque positions. Imagining myself sitting  most of the day in the office didn't seem so bad anymore - as long as my posture was correct I had nothing to fear.

Still, I noticed I would consistently get restless - I could focus on programming for a decent amount of time but I would feel an urge to move. No matter what posture I had nor how interesting the task. I felt distracted by my body wanting to move, stretch, anything...

However, I had simply accepted that as the reality of the circumstances I was in; I am a software engineer - it's natural that I develop some health issues due to sitting down all day, bent over a laptop screen. 

Yes, I know what you're thinking; try standing desks right? I have. I got an adjustable desk as soon as I had the budget for it from my internships. It's great; but then after a couple times of standing you realize it's just as uncomfortable as sitting down. In my high school days, I worked as a cashier at NoFrills. I always enjoyed working - so I would even sometimes take double shifts. I quickly learned even then that standing in one spot - even shifting back and forth is just as uncomfortable as sitting - even worse. I think cashiers should by default get at least a leaning chair or we re-design the grocery checkout entirely - something that involves movement and doesn't rely on conveyor belts. It would be more personal - cashiers would scan and pack your bags - they would move. Anyway, I'm going off track.

Going in to my last internship, things started to change. I was starting to develop wrist pain - partially from heavy late night gaming, strong key smashing when typing and poor posture during work. I don't like being uncomfortable and I love programming - I decided I will do everything it takes to not be uncomfortable while doing my favorite activity. 

I mostly stopped gaming, took long rests, used dictation software (MacOS has this built-in and it's incredible; 50% of my Slack messages sent while working from home were via dictation) and got an ergonomic keyboard which I programmed to fit my typing needs perfectly, practiced "just press hard enough so the key event is sent" typing. I rarely get wrist pain now - if I do it's mild and I just take a break. I'm going to write a long post about my wrist issues and my keyboard journey. Back to treadmill talk

// TODO: continue here
Motion sickness: When I initially started, I would get motion sickness...it sucked...sucked it up...kept going...don't get motion sickness anymore.

Focus: Was hard to focus at first few days...now it's like walking and doing stuff on your phone but better - you don't have to watch out for anything.

Productivity: through the roof

Creativity: improved. You know how people say they get great ideas when they go for a walk - well I'm always walking. 

Typing faster - Somehow - maybe because my blood is pumping more but I noticed a slight improvement in my typing. I think I type a bit faster due to my keyboard.

I've been actively using it for about a month now. Turns out that keeping your phone in your pocket allows the phone to measure (relatively accurately so as well) the distance travelled. As you can see my numbers in the past five weeks have 1.5xed. If I had been tracking my activity (didn't have an iPhone then) during past winters - I'd be lucky if I had more than ~4k average - that would have been just me going from my couch to my fridge and from my desk to my fridge.

Going back to the office now, I'm going to try to convince HR to let me have a treadmill in the office - but I feel like it's liability.

I imagine that in the future workspaces will focus more on movement. As soon as the C-suites realize that moving while working is possible and makes you more productive - a new trend will start. Hot, exciting start-up will promote their unique workspaces that have treadmills and bicycles - just as it was with beautiful, open spaces instead of cubicles. With health tech monitoring on the rise, people are becoming more health conscious. This trend will be gamified and will have a social media aspect. I already constantly hear people who are not tech savvy nor have any interest in tech talk about how many steps they had that day.  I heard this in a conversation between two elderly women in a coffee shop. Another example; a neighbor said he takes his dog on a really long walk so that he can hit his step count. Health metrics in the hands of the average person will have tremendous improvement on health in the modern world. 

Another example is my girlfriend and her friend comparing aura ring scores.

Now a word of warning - a tread mill is dynamic machinery on which you tread - the belt can slip, you can trip, or get distracted and get injured so tread cautiously.
